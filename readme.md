### How to open the list

This is how you do it elv:

1. Use your mouse to click and move the cursor (arrow thing on your screen) to the the file that says botsList.
2. After bringing the cursor there, try to spot your left mouse button. LEFT, the direction your bigger monitor is facing.
3. Now press that button.
4. The file should have now opened, congrats!

* Note: If you still weren't able to do that, you suck.
